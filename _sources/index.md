## <span style="color:black;">Preface</span>

Welcome to our GCER-Sat tutorials dedicated to the use of Python for satellite remote sensing. Python is very useful for automation and processing, and will build a lot of opportunities on the satellite image processing.


## <span style="color:black;">Our motivation</span>

We would like to bring more opportunities for new members in GCERlab, and because this research requires very specific skills we decided to catalog the basic knowledge to start on satellite image processing. This tutorial was built to be simple introduction to Python/GDAl tools for satellite visualization and manipulation for new students in the topic. Admitly, these tutorials do not contain in-depth discussion about remote sensing, but it makes possible to someone start the learning.
